  <h1>node2leaves</h1>
  
  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Return a list with the names of all leaves that can be reached from a node i_node.
    The function should call itself in a recursive way. The idea is to start
    exploring left then rigth. Takes as input the node id to start
    the recursion, a dictionary of nodes and the list of leaves which initially should be emtpy.
</p>

 
<h2>Tests</h2>
  <pre>    >>> node2leaves(1, newick_file2nodes("tree_abcdef.dnd"), [])
    ['F', 'E', 'D', 'C', 'B', 'A']
    >>> node2leaves(2, newick_file2nodes("tree_abcdef.dnd"), [])
    ['D', 'C', 'B', 'A']
    >>> node2leaves(3, newick_file2nodes("tree_abcdef.dnd"), [])
    ['B', 'A']
    >>> node2leaves(4, newick_file2nodes("tree_abcdef.dnd"), [])
    ['A']
